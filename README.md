# Browser-Drum-Set

### Description:
Inspired by Wes Bos "Java Script Drum Kit" simple app wrote in pure "Vanilla JS". 
You can play it by mouse or keyboard, also tapping screen of your mobile device. 

### Technology stack:
- HTML5 (ex. flex)
- Sass (ex. nesting, mixins),
- Java Script (core feature),
- ES6 standard (ex. interpolations)


### If you want to develop this app:
1. *In console* - clone repository by ```git clone [repository URL]```
2. *In console* - use ready package.json and install needed dependencies by ```npm install```
3. Wait a few minutes ;-) 
4. Ready to work? *In console* - use commands ```gulp sass``` and ```gulp watch```
5. Have fun!
